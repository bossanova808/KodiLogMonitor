### 📝 What is it for?
Kodi generates a log file that records everything happening in the background. This application allows you to:
* **Monitor in real-time**: See new log lines instantly as they are written (tail -f style).
* **Identify issues**: Errors are highlighted in red and warnings in orange for quick spotting.
* **Filter easily**: Focus on specific levels (Error, Warning, Info) or search for keywords.
* **Analyze setup**: Access a quick system summary to check your Kodi version and environment.
