### 📝 What is it for?
Kodi generates a log file that records everything happening in the background. This application allows you to:
* **Monitor in real-time**: See new log lines instantly as they are written (tail -f style).
* **Identify issues**: Errors are highlighted in red and warnings in orange for quick spotting.
* **Filter easily**: Focus on specific levels (Error, Warning, Info) or search for keywords.
* **Analyze setup**: Access a quick system summary to check your Kodi version and environment.

---

### 🔍 Keyword Lists (v1.2.0+)
You can now filter your logs using custom keyword lists:
* **Custom Filtering**: Create a `.txt` file in the `list_keyword` folder (one keyword or phrase per line).
* **Smart Highlighting**: The monitor only displays lines containing your keywords and highlights them for better visibility.
* **Easy Management**: Use the 📁 button to open the folder and ♻️ to refresh your lists instantly.

### 🎨 Customization (v1.2.0+)
The code is now designed for easy styling. You can find the **UI THEME** section at the very beginning of the script to change:
* **Interface Colors**: Modify backgrounds for the text area, header, and buttons.
* **Log & Highlight Colors**: Change the hex codes for `info`, `warning`, `error`, and the keyword `highlight`.
* **Centralized Design**: No need to search through the functions; everything is at the top of the file.
