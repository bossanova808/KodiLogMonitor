# Kodi Log Monitor

Kodi Log Monitor is a Python-based tool designed to monitor **Kodi.log activity in real time**.  
It provides live log tracking with filtering capabilities for warnings, errors, and custom keyword searches through a built-in search bar.

A compiled Windows binary is available, and the Python source code can be used to build the application on other operating systems.
